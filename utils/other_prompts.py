Original final answer: the pickwick papers

###
1.Title: The Pickwick Papers, Passage: The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club (also known as The Pickwick Papers) was the first novel by English author Charles Dickens. Because of his success with "Sketches by Boz" published in 1836, Dickens was asked by the publisher Chapman & Hall to supply descriptions to explain a series of comic "cockney sporting plates" by illustrator Robert Seymour, and to connect them into a novel. The book became a publishing phenomenon, with bootleg copies, theatrical performances, Sam Weller joke books, and other merchandise.

In the midst of all his activity during this period, there was discontent with his publishers and John Macrone was bought off, while Richard Bentley signed over all his rights in "Oliver Twist".

###
1.Title: 47th Academy Awards, Passage: The success of "The Godfather Part II" was notable; it received twice as many Oscars as its predecessor (six) and duplicated its feat of three Best Supporting Actor nominations (as of the 93rd Academy Awards, the last film to receive three nominations in a single acting category). Between the two of them, father and son Carmine and Francis Ford Coppola won four awards, with Carmine winning for Best Original Dramatic Score (with Nino Rota) and Francis for Picture, Director, and Best Screenplay Adapted from Other Material (with Mario Puzo).

Based on the retrieved content, five of the six Oscars can be identified. Additionally, according to my own knowledge, "The Godfather Part II" also won Best Art Direction.

According to the retrieved content, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero served as Prime Minister until December 21, 2011, and announced in April 2011 that he would not seek re-election [1]. Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, while a prominent figure within the PSOE and serving in various ministerial capacities during 2011, did not serve as Prime Minister [3].
