1.Title: Tritium, Passage: Tritium () or hydrogen-3 (symbol T or H) is a rare and radioactive isotope of hydrogen with a half-life of about 12 years. The nucleus of tritium (t, sometimes called a "triton") contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of the common isotope hydrogen-1 ("protium") contains one proton and zero neutrons, and that of hydrogen-2 ("deuterium") contains one proton and one neutron. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth. The atmosphere has only trace amounts, formed by the interaction of its gases with cosmic rays.

Modern tritium cannot be explained by Big Bang nucleosynthesis because of tritium's short half-life of 12.3 years. Today's tritium concentration is instead governed by nuclear reactions and cosmic rays.

Question: which is an example of fluorine that comes after neon
Original reason: In the periodic table, elements are arranged in order of increasing atomic number. Neon has an atomic number of 10, and Fluorine has an atomic number of 9. Therefore, Fluorine does not come after Neon.
Original final answer: none
Retrieved content:
1.Title: Periodic table, Passage: In the standard periodic table, the elements are listed in order of increasing atomic number "Z". A new row ("period") is started when a new electron shell has its first electron. Columns ("groups") are determined by the electron configuration of the atom; elements with the same number of electrons in a particular subshell fall into the same columns (e.g. oxygen, sulfur, and selenium are in the same column because they all have four electrons in the outermost p-subshell).
2.Title: Period 2 element, Passage: A period 2 element is one of the chemical elements in the second row (or period) of the periodic table of the chemical elements. The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring (periodic) trends in the chemical behavior of the elements as their atomic number increases; a new row is started when chemical behavior begins to repeat, creating columns of elements with similar properties. The second period contains the elements lithium, beryllium, boron, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and neon.
3.Title: Periodic table, Passage: This creates an analogous series in which the outer shell structures of sodium through argon are analogous to those of lithium through neon, and is the basis for the periodicity of chemical properties that the periodic table illustrates: at regular but changing intervals of atomic numbers, the properties of the chemical elements approximately repeat. The first eighteen elements can thus be arranged as the start of a periodic table. Elements in the same column have the same number of valence electrons and have analogous valence electron configurations: these columns are called groups.
